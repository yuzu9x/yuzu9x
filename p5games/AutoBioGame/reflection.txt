My idea for this game kept transforming as I was making it so my original storyboard is pretty off from what my final game came out to be. 

I had a lot of difficulty with creating this game, from aspects like choosing a name for it, the scene switching function, and many other smaller aspects about it too. I was however very excited and ambitious about it because when told it would be autobiographical, my mind instantly jumped to making a pixel art filled topdown perspective japanese RPG inspired kind of game. 
I wanted to go all out on the visual assets, but due to the time constraint it was rather difficult. I ended up combining some assets I found online with my own pixel art, to make things quicker and easier. 
blablabla uhh
