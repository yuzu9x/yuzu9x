i don't remember their names but one is an asian guy and the other one is the only white guy in the class

my original sketch was an anime girl who had the body of a stereotypical redneck american with a beer belly and America themed tattoos, and hairy bare legs to finish it off. I kind of based her design off one of the characters of this anime called Pop Team Epic, but a redneck rendition. 
in the exquisite corpse, i used her head but her torso belonged to one of my groupmates' characters where this guy is holding a lollipop. the feet portion of her new form belongs to a penguin.

the new backstory I came up with is that this character is secretly a fat penguin disguised as a person because they aren't allowed to have lollipops but are using their disguise to get away with their abnormally excessive lollipop consumption

This assignment was a lot easier compared to the last few because this one just implemented creating our own functions (then adding arguments and parameters etc) but was a lot more visually inclined and didn't have any inner workings to it so to speak. I must say though, using rudimentary shapes to create graphics is super annoying and tedious and my final design came out a lot simpler than I originally intended.
